                    Just as the COVID19 pandemic was creating upheaval and uncertainty with regards 
                    to border closures and travel restrictions, Canberra Modern was lucky enough to 
                    spend sometime at Joe’s Bar with fellow mid-century modern design fan, architectural 
                    model maker and member of the Palm Springs Modernism Week committee, David Webb. 
                    Over a few drinks we asked him about his fascinating work and what he has learnt 
                    from a lifetime passion for mid-century modern architecture.

                <p class="article-para question">
                    Canberra Modern (CM): Many mid-century modern fans would be envious of the fact 
                    that you live in Palm Springs part of the time and in Australia part of the time. 
                    Tell us a bit about your background and your work in Palm Springs.
                </p>

                <p class="article-para answer">
                    David Webb (DW): After many years living in Australia, in 2009 I moved back to Los 
                    Angeles. I was working on a model of [Richard] Neutra’s Kaufmann desert house and 
                    went out to Palm Springs to see the completed restoration. While I was out there I 
                    found a condominium for sale in Canyon View Estates designed by Palmer & Krisel in 
                    1963. It was in need of repair and I was able to afford it.<br><br>

                <p class="article-para answer">
                    My new neighbors were involved in Modernism Week. I had attended lectures on previous 
                    visits to Palm Springs and they introduced me to the organiser, Mark Davis. He asked 
                    me if I'd like to become involved. For the past eight years I have facilitated and 
                    introduced the lectures. During that time I have fallen deeper and deeper in to the 
                    rabbit hole that is architecture, design and preservation!

                <p class="article-para question">
                    CM: What do you like about mid-century modern design in general and who are the 
                    architects that inspire you?
                </p>

                <p class="article-para answer">
                    DW: When I was about twelve, I came across the famous photograph of [Frank Lloyd 
                    Wright’s] Fallingwater. I think it was in a 'Life' magazine. That was the start 
                    of a lifelong interest in architecture. I have visited the house many times and 
                    when I was in my early thirties I built a crude model of it.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p class="article-para answer">
                    Arguably, I think Wright’s DNA can be found in the work of the best architects of the 
                    twentieth century. I think it is the scale and, most importantly, the connection to the 
                    landscape. I had the opportunity to visit several houses designed by lesser known Wright 
                    apprentices a few years back. I’ve also spent time in several Neutra houses. The 
                    overwhelming feeling when you walk through the door of these houses is that you are 
                    'home'.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p class="article-para answer">
                    My interest in Wright led me to Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony. When I was 
                    living in Sydney I went to look at a house in Castlecrag that I was told had been 
                    the original display home. There was a plan to restore it and build a second residence 
                    on the lot. The architect chosen for this task was Bruce Rickard. Before work commenced 
                    they staged a small exhibition of his work. His early houses were very 'Wrightian' but 
                    I particularly liked a small house he had designed for himself and his family in Cottage 
                    Point [NSW].
