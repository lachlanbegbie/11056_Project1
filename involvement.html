                                    Growing up in Canberra in the 1950s & ’60s was an immersive Modernist experience 
                                    for David Brand, a Melbourne based architect born and raised in Deakin. Their 
                                    houses and gardens express the ideals of Modern Australian living, in a Post-War 
                                    age of austerity, and optimism.

                                    and attitudes, its unique Canberran demographics.

                                <p>
                                    Post WWII and entering the cold war era, architects and bureaucrats alike were 
                                    prepared for anything. Built in 1954, University House was the crown jewel of 
                                    the newly established Australian National University, but more than just 
                                    accommodation for staff and students, the building offered a secret safe haven 
                                    in the event of a military attack on the capital in the form of complex underground 
                                    tunnels. Join Canberra Modern’s Amy Jarvis and Tim the Yowie Man on a behind the 
                                    scenes tour of these tunnels and learn how this building, and the rest of ANU hold 
                                    a myriad of secrets and mysteries within their design and history.
