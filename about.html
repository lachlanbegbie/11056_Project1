                    <h2>What's so special about Canberra?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Canberra is a young city with a rich architectural legacy. With major boom periods
                        in the 1920s and again from the 1950s-1980s – the architectural aesthetic of the city 
                        is eclectic, but deliberately cohesive.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The mid-late twentieth century period of development in Canberra, specifically during 
                        the National Capital Development Commission’s (NCDC) oversight (1958-1989) has not been 
                        widely celebrated or recognised by the Canberra community.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Major developments not only in residential, but civic and community buildings saw the 
                        frequent involvement of architects now considered pioneers of the modernist movement, 
                        and the construction of a key collection of iconic and unique mid-century buildings in 
                        Australia.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Many of these structures, which make an irreplaceable contribution to Canberra, have 
                        already been lost and many face risk of being lost in the near future.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        So we at Canberra Modern are here to help by engaging Canberra and Australia with their 
                        contemporary National Capital.
